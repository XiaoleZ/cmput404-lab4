1. https://github.com/XiaoleZ/cmput404-lab4.git
2. (The default page) The page shows the django install successfully
3. /: YOu got 404, page not found
   /polls: "Hello, world. You're at the poll index."
4. Migrations are the way of propagating changes to the models into the database.
  you have changed the models and you want to tell Django that you have changed the models.
5. default site Administration page.  
register model, such as:
from .models import Choice, Question
admin.site.register(Choice)
admin.site.register(Question)
6. 
"You're looking at question 83."
"You're looing at the results of question 83"
"You're voting on question 83."
You got 404. page not found. change the "int" to "str" then you are able to see the string now.
7.when we have multiple template, we need change manually one by one. we want it to change automatically.
8. use generic view to reduce the redundancy. if you don't want to display something/render anything, you don't have to use the generic view.
